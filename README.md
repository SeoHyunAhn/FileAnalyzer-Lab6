Name: File Analyzer 

Description: When using files, there are some situations that you would like to manipulate those files. Because of this issue, we have created a file analyzing website that would be useful for people who want to send files privately and search for more information. Our website would include features including encoding/decoding, sorting, translator and how many of them appear. With this, we would be able to send informations more efficiently and have a better understanding of the information sent by others.
