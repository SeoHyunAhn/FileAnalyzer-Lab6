Name: Straight Eye

Description: When chatting on website, there are some messages that you donâ€™t want others to know. Because of this issue, we have created a chatting website that would be useful for people who want to send messages privately and search for more information. Our website would include features including encoding/decoding, sorting, number of lines/words/character and how many of them appear. With this, we would be able to send informations more efficiently and have a better understanding of the information sent by others. And even if you leave the location, others will not know what the chat is about, increasing the security of your messages.
